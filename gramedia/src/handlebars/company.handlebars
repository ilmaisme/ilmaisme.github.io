                Everything that is big and significant starts small and grows over time. That is how
                Gramedia started.
                The long history of success began from a single bookstore in 1970. Built at Jl. Gajah
                Mada, it was a
                small store of only 252 square feet. But P.K. Ojong, Gramedia’s founder, had a big
                dream. He dreamed of
                helping as many Indonesians as possible to learn and thrive by providing books,
                stationery and
                everything essential to acquire knowledge.
